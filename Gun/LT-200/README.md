# AK-77
 Before this is not ready to use resource pack (im just some lazy peeps tho)
 just place texture on texture\custom\blunderbuss folder (you can change dirdctiory 
 and rename blunderbuss and blunderbuss_full to whatever block you want to get replace (remember its a cutout rendering block) and place it on model\blocks
 There is a license to protect this but you can modify and publish (as long as you need my permission and credit me to arKanSMC on planet minecraft or IDK on discord) but you cant redistribute it and publish the modify you make without my permission
 and then thanks for downloading my model theres will be more

# Spefication
 LT-200 was laser thrower series 200 first gen. it still on experimental stage and will be more advance on future. LT-200 was directed-energy weapon based on infrared that make thermal blooming so it can destroy vechile or punch back
 by a high spike different temperature or train of brief pulses of light. the rapid evaporation and expansion of the surface causes shockwaves that damage the target. we been solve
 this major problem and use their power (thermal blooming) to maske this weapon more dangerous but we still fixed some problem when fog, smoke, dust, rain, snow, smog, foam, or purposely dispersed obscurant chemicals in the air on
 the gun we try to move the iron very fast that it will gonna make anything said before not in the barrel and control the thermal blooming but still in on progress. its been banned for public since it can make temporary or even
 permanent vision loss. it was a medium range (150m) 40-gW use ATLWS (Artificial Target Laser Weapon Systems) made by Slime GunStation owned by Slimey inc. it also can be toggle as electrolaser that shoot ionized oxygen but becareful\
 since it very hot and can melt iron and it also need ionization stick used to fill the gun it take 20 sec to full and use 60-gW (more than the capacity weapon has so you need another eletric producer)
