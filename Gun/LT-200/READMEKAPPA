Thank you for read my beatiful text that have good gramma

Before this is not ready to use resource pack (im just some lazy peeps tho)

just place texture on texture\custom\blunderbuss folder (you can change dirdctiory 

and rename blunderbuss and blunderbuss_full to whatever block you want to get replace (remember its a cutout rendering block) and place it on model\blocks

There is no license to protect this so you can modify and publish (you need my permission and credit me to arKanSMC on planet minecraft or IDK on discord) but you cant redistribute it and publish the modify you make without my permission

and then thanks for downloading my model theres will be more 

*for sure* :eyes:
